# The following combination of tasks produces the bandstructure 
# and the electron polarisability within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) for 
# Single Layer Graphene (SLG)
! task 'bands' allows to get the bandstrucuture. The output is 'bands.out',
! which has a set of x-y data blocks (i.e., can be plotted with xmgrace)
! task 'eigen' allows to get the egenvalues/eigenvectors, the solutions of the TB Hamiltonian
! these are served as an input for the 'rpachi' task, to get the polarisability function
! in the 'chi.dat' file, wich has also x-y data block format (unsorted with x)

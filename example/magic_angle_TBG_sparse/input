! desired lower, uppare states to compute, note that (1) sparse eigensolver
! can not give give exactly that states, but it gives states closed to efermi 
! (the input parameter). (2) if upper state index is larger then number of available
! states, it will be modified, lower state will be allose modified, such that its
! index is less or equal index of upper state
